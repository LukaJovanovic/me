TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
  list = ['*']
    for element in list:
        return list*10

            pyra = []
    for a in range (1,6):
        pyra2 = []
        for b in range (1,10):
            u = 0
            v = 5
            if b > v - a and b < v + a:
                pyra2.append("*")
            else:
                pyra2.append(" ")
            u = u + 1
        pyra.append(pyra2)
    return pyra

this and more good to consistently study
